# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Ruby blocks are functions that can be passed into a methods. Blocks dont have names.

  Researched answer:In short, blocks are unnamed methods. They are passed to methods just like other objects. Blocks consist of code between braces or a do/end pair. Block become helpful when using shared logic to various context.



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is a Ruby package that contains a library. They help functionality of Ruby applications.

  Researched answer: Ruby gems are basically open source libraries that contain Ruby code and are sprinkled with a little extra data. These gems allow us to use some of the code within the gem, without explicitly inserting that code. (https://rubygems.org/.) Awesome, so there are a plethora of gems to explore with a multitube of purposes. Here's a couple of basics. Bundler, which provides a consistent environment for Ruby project by tracking and installing the ideal gems and versions that are needed. #1 downloaded gem of all time. RSpec, is a testing framework for Ruby. Devise is a authentication for user logins. Also, Rails is a gem! Rails provides the fullstack framework that allows Ruby to be transformed into web applications. Appearntly Ruby is basically a 'one-stop-shop' for web dev. 



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a backend framework, that gives developers a time saving method for writing code. Its pre-built structure make web development easier. Rails emphasizes the concepts like: convention over configuration(Co
  C), don't repeat yourself(DRY), and the active record pattern.

  Researched answer: Ok, just learned Ruby on Rails is a gem! More importantly, Rails is a web framework. However, there should be clarity on, what a framework is to fully understand how powerful this tool is. So, what is a framework? A framework simplifies the development of web applications, by providing default structures for your code, any database utilized, and web pages the application will serve. In the military, we call this breaking it down Barney style! Frameworks are like Legos. Yes, "Legos"! Frameworks, give you pre-built "legos" of code that allow mix, match, and modify to allow custom created applications. Rails uses the Model-View-Controler pattern for development. Model-View-Controller pattern divides a app code into 3 interconnected parts. The Model, which holds the data structure of the application. The View, represents the visual par of the web app. Lastly the Controller, which connects data to the View, also it contains the apps logic.  MVC is what makes Rails so versitile and useful.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: Relational database is a type of database that provides access to info or data that are related to one another. Non relational databases is a thing.

  Researched answer: A Boring research answer: A Relational database is a type of database that provides access to info or data that are related to one another. Ok, thats cool! So let's imagine that databases are like magical toy boxes! Toys can be placed into this toy box all messed up and out of order, but this toybox is truly magical, because it will shuffle all the toys into order no matter what. So now, once you ask the box for a desired toy it quickly finds the selected item. Whether, the queiry is for toy cars or only blue toy cars the magical toy box database quickly finds the selected item. That's how databases work! However, the most common databases would store your toys in pieces. It might make sense, for example, to create a second box inside your toy box (database) to store all the heads of your dolls and another box to store arms. That type of database is called a relational database because it keeps track of which arms and heads go with (relate to) which dolls. But thereâ€™s a newer type of database which lets you keep your dolls in one piece. That kind of database is called a non-relational database. 



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: A key that identifies a particular database. They are important because they show relationships between records.

  Researched answer: Primary keys are essential in relational databases because they are used to define relationships between records



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: (Representation State Transfer) is an architectural style for defining our routes. It maps http routes and the CRUD functionalities.

2. JSON:JavaScript Object Notation Is a data-interchange format. It is easier for humans to read and write.

3. ERB: Templating system for Ruby

4. Params: Params in RUBY is a hash. Basically, Its the collection of data received during http request

5. API: Application Programming Interface. API's are cool, they give developers access to software resources.
